# GaraTrac

A native Android tracker application built with Jetpack Compose using Material 3 design. 
Made for fun over winter break, so nothing too serious here.

## Development

If you wish to see the code for some reason, open the project in Android Studio and sync Gradle project.

## Configuration

To use your own server, you need a backend server with an API like [this](https://github.com/perifural/tracker/blob/main/v2/server.js).
Configure the **Server URL** and **Device ID** in the app settings.

| Feature                    | Description                                                                 | Status      |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| **Cloud-Native Backend**   | Likely next step, put database and APIs on the cloud.                       | ⭐ Likely    |
| **Android Auto Support**   | Fun, but impractical as we need to release on Google Play Store.            | 🥲 Unlikely |
| **Visual Upgrades**        | More customizations, animations and theming.                                | ⭐ Likely    |
| **osmdriod Migration**     | Migrate from unmaintained library to an alternative.                        | ❔ idk       |
| **Multi-device Support**   | Track multiple devices on the same map view.                                | ❔ Maybe     |
| **"Battery Optimization"** | Something about [not killing the app](https://dontkillmyapp.com/), I guess. | ❔ Maybe     |
| **Authentication**         | Multi-user stuff, requires backend changes.                                 | ❔ idk       |
